| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Editing activities

To make it easier for teachers to add or change activities without touching Python code, the application now loads activities from `src/activities.json`.

- Edit `src/activities.json` to add/remove activities or change descriptions, schedules, and capacities.
- The server will read this file on startup. When the file is missing the app will create it with default activities.

Keep in mind the data is still stored in-memory during runtime; changes to `activities.json` will be picked up on server restart or reload.
